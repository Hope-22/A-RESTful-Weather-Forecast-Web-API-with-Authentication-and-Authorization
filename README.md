# A-RESTful-Weather-Forecast-Web-API-with-Authentication-and-Authorization
A simple RESTFUL weather forecast web API with Authentication and Authorization Implementation.
Used Entity Framework Core and SQL Server to store the registered users in the database.
JSON Web Token(JWT) was used to securely transfer information over the web(between two parties).
It was used for the authentication system and can also be used for information exchange.
The token is mainly composed of header, payload, signature.
